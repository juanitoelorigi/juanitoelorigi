### / Philosophy

My approach to development is grounded in **essentialism**. I believe software should be as clean as it is functional. I specialize in stripping away the unnecessary to focus on what matters: robust architecture, seamless user experiences, and pixel-perfect implementation using modern tools like **Tailwind CSS** and **Supabase**.
